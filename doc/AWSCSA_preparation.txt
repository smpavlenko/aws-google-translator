AWS Preparation
1. Essentials
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Six advantages of Cloud computing
    - Variable vs. Capital Expense
    - Economies of Scale
    - Stop Guessing Capacity
    - Increase Speed and Agility
    - Focus on Business Differentiators
    - Go Global in Minutes

2. S3
Bucket is a container (web folder) for objects (files) stored in Amazon S3. Buckets form the top-level namespace for
Amazon S3, and bucket names are global. Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts.
    - S3 standard storage is designed for 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.
    - Amazon Glacier is designed for 99.999999999% durability.
Virtual-Hosted–Style URL
    - URL http://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com
    - URL http://<bucket-name>.s3-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
    - URL http://<bucket-name>.s3.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
Path-style URL
    - URL http://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name> for US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1)
    - URL http://s3-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>
    - URL http://s3.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>
Static Website Hosting
    - URL <bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
    - URL <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
Amazon S3 Standard offers high durability, high availability, low latency, and high performance object storage for
general purpose use.
Amazon S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) offers the same durability, low latency, and high throughput as
Amazon S3 Standard, but is designed for long-lived, less frequently accessed data (transition after 30 days).
Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) offers slightly lower durability (4 nines) than Standard or Standard-IA at a
reduced cost.
Amazon Glacier storage class offers secure, durable, and extremely low-cost cloud storage for data that does not require
 real-time access, such as archives and long-term backups (transition after 90 days).
Encryption
    - SSE-S3 (AWS-Managed Keys)
    - SSE-KMS (AWS KMS Keys)
    - SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)
    - Client-Side Encryption
Pre-Signed URLs - to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.
Multipart Upload - allows you to upload large objects as a set of parts, which generally gives better network
utilization (through parallel transfers), the ability to pause and resume, and the ability to upload objects where the size is initially unknown.
Cross-region replication is a feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to asynchronously replicate all new objects in the source bucket in one AWS region to a target bucket in another region.
Event Notifications - can be sent in response to actions taken on objects uploaded or stored in Amazon S3.
    - to Amazon SNS
    - to Amazon SQS
    - to AWS Lambda

3. EC2

4. VPC
Amazon VPC
    - per one region
    - up to 5 VPC per region
Subnets - a segment of an Amazon VPC
    - per one az
    - public(has route to IGW), private(doesn't have route to IGW), or VPN-only(has route only to VPG)
    - every vpc should have at least two - private and public
    - up to 200 subnets per VPC
    - traffic is routed between subnets by default (use ACL to prevent)
Route Tables - a logical construct within an Amazon VPC that contains a set of rules (called routes) that are applied to the subnet and used to determine where network traffic is directed
    - Main Route Tables/Custom Route Tables
    - one Route Table can be attached to multiple subnets
    - each subnet can be attached to one Route Table
Internet Gateways - is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available Amazon VPC component that allows communication between instances in your Amazon VPC and the Internet
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - allows you to direct Amazon EC2 host name assignment to your own resources
Elastic IP Address
    - specific to a region
    - costs money even if not used
Elastic Network Interface - a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in an Amazon VPC
VPC endpoint - enables to create a private connection between your Amazon VPC and another AWS service
    - enables to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection
    - there are two types of VPC endpoints: Interface, Gateway
Peering connection - a networking connection between two Amazon VPCs that enables instances in either Amazon VPC to
communicate with each other as if they are within the same network
    - cannot create a peering connection between Amazon VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks
    - do not support transitive routing
    - VPCs can be in different regions
    - two VPCs could have only one peering connection
Security Group - virtual stateful firewall that controls inbound and outbound network traffic to AWS resources and Amazon EC2 instances
    - default security group allows communication between all resources within the security group, allows all outbound traffic, and denies all other traffic
    - you may not delete the default security group
    - up to 500 security groups for each Amazon VPC
    - up to 50 inbound and 50 outbound rules to each security group
    - can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
    - security groups are stateful. This means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow outbound regardless of outbound rules and vice versa
Network Access Control List - another layer of security that acts as a stateless firewall on a subnet level
    - every subnet must be associated with a network ACL
    - supports allow rules and deny rules
    - Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules
    - automatically applied to all instances in the associated subnets
    - one Network ACL can be attached to multiple subnets
    - each subnet can be attached to one Network ACL
NAT Instance - an Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is designed to accept traffic from instances within a
private subnet, translate the source IP address to the public IP address of the NAT instance, and forward the traffic to
 the IGW. Obsolete, use NAT Gateway instead
NAT Gateway - managed resource that is designed to operate just like a NAT instance
    - within an Availability Zone
Virtual Private Gateway - the VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection between the two networks
Customer Gateway - represents a physical device or a software application on the customer’s side of the VPN connection
Virtual Private Network
